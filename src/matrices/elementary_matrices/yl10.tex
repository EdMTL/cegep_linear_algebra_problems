Determine whether the following statement is true or false for any $n\times n$
matrices $A$ and $B$.  If the statement is false provide a counterexample. If the
statement is true provide a proof of the statement.\\

If $A$ and $B$ are invertible then $A$ and $B$ are row equivalent.
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
True, the reduced row echelon form of $A$ and $B$ is $I$ since both matrices are invertible.  Hence there exists a finite sequence of elementary row operations that when applied on $A$ result in $I$. And a second finite sequence of elementary row operations that when applied on $B$ result in $I$.  If the first sequence of elementary row operations is applied on $A$ followed by the inverse elementary row operations applied in reverse order of the second sequence of elemtary row operations then $B$ is obtained.  Hence $A$ and $B$ are row equivalent.
